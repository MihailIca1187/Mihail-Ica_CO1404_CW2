The following repo contains my version of the university assignment that I completed as a final assignment of the year. The concept of this assignment is that of a text
censoring tool where certain words are censored even if they are contained within other words. The program is given a text file with words to censor, text file(s) to
filter and it writes the censored text to separate text files.

This has been done using the fstream library, STL vectors with advanced use of iterators and pointers. 

The program is relatively simple with clear, concise and well commented code.


The main challenges I have faced during the development of this program were centred around censoring the words correctly and writing the censored text adequately.

This has been a great opportunity to learn about the smart use of STL classes as well as the importance of writing clear, understandable code.
